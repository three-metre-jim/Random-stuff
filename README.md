Random bits and pieces

If you are wondering what these files are, they are small (self contained) random html5 / javascript code that does something useful, or unexpected (FBJoke.html).
Experimenting with the Webaudio API, and the use of open graph meta-tags for a custom preview on FaceBook.

commonly used by scammers. Unfortunately my previous FB posts containing those links were also removed without warning, so I came here.
Let's see how long GH links last on FB...
